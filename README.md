N-Queens Problem Solver:
This Python script provides a graphical solution to the classic N-Queens problem using Tkinter for GUI.


Introduction:
The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in chessboard mathematics and computer science. The task is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.
